# AndroidApp_Buttons
This is the first of a serie of very simple android apps developed in Android Studio(with Java). 
I'm following an Udemy course and I intend to keep uploading examples of code to show what I've learnt so far. 
My final goal is to be able to develop advanced apps by myself.


This one counts with 3 different ways to make buttons work and it also shows the programmer the app life cycle.
